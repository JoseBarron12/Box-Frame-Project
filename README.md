# Box Frame Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Box Frame Project! This project is a C++ program designed to create framed words, allowing the user to customize the framing style and centering options. The program takes input either from the keyboard or a file, processes the words, and then frames them accordingly.

## Features

- Create framed words with customizable frame characters.
- Choose centering options: center, left, or right.
- Input words from the keyboard or a file.

## Test Runs

The project has undergone several test runs to ensure its functionality and correctness. Test cases cover various scenarios, such as keyboard input, file input, different centering options, and frame characters.

1. Keyboard Input - Centered Frame
   - User enters a sentence from the keyboard.
   - Words are framed with a centered style.

2. Keyboard Input - Left Aligned Frame
   - User enters a sentence from the keyboard.
   - Words are framed with a left-aligned style.

3. File Input - Right Aligned Frame
   - User provides a file containing phrases.
   - Phrases are framed with a right-aligned style.

4. File Input - Centered Frame
   - User provides another file with phrases.
   - Phrases are framed with a centered style.

## Code Organization

All the code for this project is located in the accompanying PDF file named `Box_Frame_Project.pdf`. The document is structured to be read from left to right, providing a detailed explanation of the code, its functions, and the rationale behind design decisions.
